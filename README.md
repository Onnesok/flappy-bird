# Flappy bird with flutter

Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive mobile game where players navigate a bird through a series of pipes by tapping the screen to keep it airborne. Despite its basic mechanics, the game gained immense popularity for its challenging gameplay and retro graphics.

So I decided to make my own Flappy bird clone using flutter.
