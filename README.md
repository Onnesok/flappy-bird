Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive mobile game where players navigate a bird through a series of pipes by tapping the screen to keep it airborne. Despite its basic mechanics, the game gained immense popularity for its challenging gameplay and retro graphics.

I decided to make my own Flappy Bird clone using Flutter. I have used the `flame` game engine, a 2D game engine for Flutter game development.
